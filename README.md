## Description

This website is designed to allow you to type in a location 

and it will give you the weather for that day and the next

5 days after. It's supposed to connect to the OpenWeatherAPI

and show the weather from that website.

## Usage

The usage of this is to check the weather forecast in the area

that the user looks into.

## Resources

## Status

The status of this project is not complete. When I type in a place

the API just keeps giving me a 401 error message, which means that

it is a problem with the link in the code itself. I tried to cut down 

the link to a very simple url with nothing extra added onto it, but even

that didn't work. I directly copy and pasted the api key from their email.

I'll have to shelf this and move on. This upcoming project will be better.
